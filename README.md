[Canvas Lab](http://yadonchow.com/projects/canvaslab) is an experimental tool providing an Illustrator-like interface for working with shapes in HTML5's canvas element.

The canvas element, introduced as a part of HTML5, is extremely powerful and allows for custom shapes to be drawn and manipulated through lines and bezier curves. However, HTML5 canvas’s usage is not very intuitive, and makes building custom shapes quite frustrating. Canvas Lab is meant to offer an Illustrator-like interface to develop shapes, and will output the necessary Javascript code once you’re finished.

Canvas Lab currently has the following features:
* Up to 100 sides
* The shape’s fill color can be specified with RGB values
* Sides can be converted to curves, with accompanying bezier handles
* Points can be manipulated either by specifying specific x-y values or by dragging points with the mouse
* Point markers can be toggled on or off
* A grid can be shown or hidden
* The grid's increment value can be customized
* "Snap to grid" can also be activated.
